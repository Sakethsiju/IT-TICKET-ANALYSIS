System-related tickets (40%) were the most common, indicating higher dependency on core infrastructure.

Average resolution time: 4.6 days — steady despite rising workloads.

Customer satisfaction improved slightly from 4.0 (2016) to 4.2 (2020), indicating better service quality.

A weak negative correlation was found between issue severity and resolution time.
